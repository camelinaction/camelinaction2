/**
 * A set of routes that watches a directory for new orders, reads them, converts the order 
 * file into a JMS Message and then sends it to the JMS incomingOrders queue hosted 
 * on an embedded ActiveMQ broker instance.
 * 
 * From there a content-based router is used to send the order to either the
 * xmlOrders or csvOrders queue. If an order file does not end with the
 * csv, csl, or xml extension the order is sent to the badOrders queue. 
 * 
 * Orders on the xmlOrders queue are also filtered such that only orders that do not 
 * have the “test” attribute set will pass through.
