In the middle the data type should be changed from int to integer:

- .param().name("id").dataType("int").description("The order id").endParam()
+ .param().name("id").dataType("integer").description("The order id").endParam()

- <param name="id" type="path" dataType="int" description="The order id"/>
+ <param name="id" type="path" dataType="integer" description="The order id"/>

p510

The example in section 11.5.1 Using onWhen on page 510 needs to add @ExchangeException
to the parameter to bind the parameter to the caused exception, in listing 11.16:

- public static boolean isIllegalDataError(HttpOperationFailedException cause)
+ public static boolean isIllegalDataError(@ExchangeException HttpOperationFailedException cause)

And the code snippet in the middle of page 510 needs to use the correct method name:

- .onWhen(bean(MyHttpUtil.class, "isIllegalData"))
+ .onWhen(bean(MyHttpUtil.class, "isIllegalDataError"))


p831 and 832

The built in operator examples which is using the ${in.header.xxx} syntax
should be replaced with ${header.xxx} because the in.* syntax has been
deprecated.
